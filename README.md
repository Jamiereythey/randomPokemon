# Generate a Random Kanto Pokemon Team!

## How to Use

Click the button to generate a random Pokemon in each of the six on-screen <div> containers. This will run a function calling for a random number between 1-151 and assigning it to the corresponding National Dex Pokemon.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

Along with the name and number being generated, I will add a stylized sprite image for each Pokemon generated in each div.

Playing with background images and how they interact with the div containers via CSS style blurs, transparency, etc.

Generate the Pokemon's "cry" when clicking on the generated sprite image
